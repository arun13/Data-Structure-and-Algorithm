Question 8: What is the difference between Stack and Queue data structure?
One of the classical data structure interviews question. 
I guess every one know, No? Any way main difference is that Stack is LIFO(Last In First Out) data structure 
while Queue is a FIFO(First In First Out) data structure.


A Stack is an abstract data type or collection where in Push,
the addition of data elements to the collection, and Pop, 
the removal of data elements from the collection, are the major operations performed on the collection.
The Push and Pop operations are performed only at one end of the Stack which is referred to as the 'top of the stack'.

In other words,a Stack can be simply defined as Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure,i.e.,
the last element added at the top of the stack(In) should be the first element to be removed(Out) from the stack.
Stack Operations:

Push: A new entity can be added to the top of the collection.
Pop: An entity will be removed from the top of the collection.
Peek or Top: Returns the top of the entity with out removing it.

Overflow State: A stack may be implemented to have a bounded capacity. 
If the stack is full and does not contain enough space to accept an entity to be pushed, 
the stack is then considered to be in an overflow state.

Underflow State: The pop operation removes an item from the top of the stack.
 A pop either reveals previously concealed items or results in an empty stack, but, if the stack is empty, 
 it goes into underflow state, which means no items are present in stack to be removed.
